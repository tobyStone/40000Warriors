40000 Warriors

A 2D side‑scroll action game built with Python and Pygame, featuring a Space Marine Scout battling hordes of Tyranid enemies through gothic halls and boss arenas.

🔥 Features

Player: Control a Space Marine Scout with ranged and melee attacks, ammo management, health and armor.

Tyranid Enemies: Variety of Tyranid types (Genestealer, Warrior, Gaunt, Lictor, Carnifex, Zoanthrope, Mawloc, etc.) with unique stats and behaviors.

NPC System: Interact with NPCs (Sergeant Tarkus, Magos Vex, Inquisitor Kryptman) to drive objectives.

Room System: Four distinct rooms (Main Hall, Armory, Chapel, Boss Arena) with smooth transitions.

Bosses: Special boss encounters with unique mechanics (ground pound, psychic blast, swoop attacks).

Pickups & UI: Ammo, health pickups; on‑screen bars, kill counter, objectives display.

Cutscene Player: Intro video support (assets/cut_scenes/intro.mp4).

Configurable Sprite Loader:

Loads from assets/character/ (PNG filenames are matched case‑insensitive, dash/underscore tolerant).

Falls back to assets/enemies/ or a magenta placeholder if missing.

Auto‑scales sprites to hitbox sizes; global scale factor configurable via TYRANID_SCALE.

Easy Tyranid Control: Disable or resize enemy types by editing tyranid_sprites.py (comment out in factory or adjust hitbox parameters).

⚙️ Customization & Tips

Sprite Scale: Tweak TYRANID_SCALE at the top of tyranid_sprites.py to uniformly resize all enemies.

Enable/Disable Enemies: Comment out unwanted entries in the create_tyranid factory or TYRANID_COLORS map.

Asset Paths: The loader first checks assets/character/, then assets/enemies/ if configured, then falls back to a placeholder.

Python Launcher Flags: Use py -3.9 main_game.py to pin the interpreter version.

❓ Troubleshooting

-3.9 not recognized: Ensure the Python launcher is installed. Activate your venv and run python main_game.py instead.

Sprites appear as colored boxes: Verify your PNG filenames exactly match (case‑insensitive) the type names (e.g., carnifex.png, hive_tyrant.png) in assets/character/.

Cutscene fails: Check that assets/cut_scenes/intro.mp4 exists, or remove/rename that file to skip the intro.
